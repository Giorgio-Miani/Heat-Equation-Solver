# High Performance Scientific Computing in Aerospace 2023/2024
Projects realized for the first module of the "High Performance Scientific Computing in Aerospace" course at Politecnico di Milano.

**Tutor:** Prof. Auteri Franco   
**Final grade:** 30/30

**Topic:** Heat Equation
The aim of the project is to implement an efficient and parallelized solver for the Heat Equation. Every step for the development of the code is loaded on the repository, starting from the simple 1-dimensional and stationary case, to the 3D Time Dependent one, solved using a parallel and efficient code. Comparison and results with multiple techniques and parallelization methods are shown in the report file.\
Make sure to install the *2decomp_fft* library before running the parallel solver, for more details the library documentation and github links are left below.
